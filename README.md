# nanokit
materials/parts/instructions for low-budget and diy nanoscience

This project aims to make it easier for hobbyists and budget-constrained labs to run experiments of the sorts needed to develop atomically precise machines and in-space manufacturing devices. To that end, we will develop desk-side (<2m tall) and desk-top (<0.5m tall) versions of the following:

* ultra-high vacuum chamber and pumping system
* fiber drawing tower
* mass spectrometer
